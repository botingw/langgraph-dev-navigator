# LangChain Agent Workflow Plan

## 1. First Principles

1. **Executable Truth**: Every agent workflow and code sample must be runnable, tested, and version-pinned to prevent drift and reduce hallucinated/outdated code.
2. **Observability by Default**: Every workflow must include tracing and evaluation hooks (e.g., LangSmith) from the start to make agent decisions and bugs transparent.
3. **Bias and Compliance as Product Requirements**: For agentic workflows in sensitive domains (e.g., hiring), bias, privacy, and fairness must be continuously monitored and enforced.
4. **Automated Maintenance**: Use CI/CD to ensure breaking changes in LangChain/LangGraph and their ecosystem are caught and fixed proactively.
5. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Use clear, structured prompts/specifications for agent design. Human review of the spec comes before code generation to avoid vague or hallucinated plans.

## 2. Workflow Overview

1. **Define intention:** Human writes a one-sentence or structured prompt describing the desired agentic workflow (e.g., resume screening agent).
2. **AI generates a structured spec:** AI outputs a JSON or outline of nodes, tools, inputs/outputs, and success criteria.
3. **Human reviews/edits spec:** The human verifies/clarifies requirements and trims hallucinations.
4. **AI generates code scaffold & tests:** AI converts the approved spec to Python code and pytest cases. All dependencies (LangChain, LangGraph, etc.) must be version-pinned.
5. **CI pipeline runs:** All tests must pass in CI; fails if broken APIs, test errors, or regressions are detected.
6. **Instrument tracing & evaluation:** Every agent execution is wrapped with LangSmith or similar tracing. Evaluators and logs are added for debugging and performance review.
7. **Bias & compliance checks:** For sensitive workflows, run agent outputs over a synthetic, balanced dataset and block merges if bias or fairness thresholds are violated.
8. **Iterate & deploy:** Fix weakest node or failing spec; once green, optionally deploy as a LangServe endpoint for interactive or downstream use.
9. **Automated maintenance:** Weekly CI and dependency-bump bots ensure the workflow stays current as upstream libraries change.

## 3. Pitfalls & Mitigations

| Pitfall                       | Impact                                 | Mitigation                                           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stale APIs**                | Silent runtime breakage                | Pin dependencies; CI fails on breaking change        |
| **Hallucinated code/Classes** | Unrunnable or incorrect agent logic    | Require runnable scaffold + pytest for each change   |
| **Bias/Compliance risk**      | Legal/ethical exposure in hiring, etc. | Synthetic dataset audit; fairness checks in CI       |
| **Silent runtime errors**     | Loss of trust, hard-to-diagnose bugs   | Default tracing and evaluation on every agent run    |
| **Runaway cost/memory**       | Cost blowouts, OOM errors              | Set memory/token budget and budget hooks in agents   |
| **Docs/code drift**           | Inaccurate AI-generated completions    | Automated doc generation from tested code            |
| **Secret/key leakage**        | Security exposure                      | Always load keys from .env and redact sensitive logs |
| **Prompt-injection, SQLi**    | Security vulnerabilities               | Validate all tool/model inputs, especially external  |

## 4. Prioritized Roadmap

*For concrete IDE setup steps, see **ide\_integration\_guide.md**.*

### Immediate (Week 1)

1. **Pin LangChain/LangGraph versions** in `pyproject.toml` & lockfile
2. **Scaffold minimal agent + pytest** that loads a dummy résumé and returns a score
3. **Set up GitHub Action:** run tests on push & weekly schedule

### Next (Week 2)

4. **Wrap every run with LangSmith tracing**
5. **Adopt JSON/spec step** for human-AI agent design (prompt → spec → code)
6. **Synthetic balanced dataset + bias/fairness test** (block merge if failing)

### Soon (after Week 2)

7. **Token/cost guards in agents**
8. **Establish Local LangGraph Repo as the Knowledge Base** <!-- CHANGED: Rephrased from "Curate official resource..." -->
9. **Enable LangServe endpoint for interactive/manual QA**

### Later

10. **Weekly dependency update bot**
11. **Automated doc generation** (pytest-markdown, etc)
12. **Security fuzz/prompt-injection/SQLi tests**

## 5. Reference Resources (Knowledge Base)

### 5.1. Primary Source of Truth: The Local Repository

The primary knowledge base for all development is a local clone of the official `langchain-ai/langgraph` repository. The AI assistant **must** prioritize file-based lookups (`@file`) into the `docs/docs/` directory of this clone. This ensures all generated code is aligned with the specific, version-controlled documentation.

**Example primary reference:** `../langgraph/docs/docs/concepts/state.md`

### 5.2. Secondary External Reading

The following external links are for human reference and supplementary context only. They **should not** be the AI's primary source for code generation, as they can become outdated.

## 6. Success Metrics

* **Every sample is executable and covered by CI.**
* **No merge allowed if bias/fairness checks fail.**
* **Docs and code never diverge (auto-generated docs).**
* **LLMs (e.g., Cursor, Cline) reference only the up-to-date, tested snippets.**
* **All secrets and PII handled securely.**
* **Automated drift checks catch breaking changes before users do.**
