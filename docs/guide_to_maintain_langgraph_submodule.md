# Simple Guide to Updating the `langgraph` Submodule

This is the quick workflow for updating our local `langgraph` knowledge base to the latest official version.

### Step 1: Update the Submodule's Content

This command sequence enters the submodule directory, switches to the `main` branch, and pulls the latest content from the official repository.

```bash
cd langgraph
git checkout main
git pull origin main
cd ..
```

### Step 2: Record the Update in the Main Project

After updating the submodule, you must commit this change to the main `LangGraph-Dev-Navigator` repository. This "locks in" the new version for everyone else.

```bash
# Stage the submodule update
git add langgraph

# Commit the change with a clear message
git commit -m "Update langgraph submodule to latest version"
```

That's it. The submodule is now updated.
