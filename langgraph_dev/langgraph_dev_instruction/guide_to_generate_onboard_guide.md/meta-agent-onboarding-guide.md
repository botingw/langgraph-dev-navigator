# Meta-Guide: Onboarding and Maintaining the LangGraph AI Assistant

This document outlines the high-level concepts and best practices for creating, maintaining, and updating the system prompts that govern the AI assistant. It serves as an "onboarding guide" for developers who need to modify or extend the AI's core capabilities.

### The Core Concept: The "Digital Apprentice" Model

Think of the system prompt not as a simple instruction, but as a comprehensive **job description, employee handbook, and training manual** for a new digital apprentice. This apprentice is the Large Language Model (LLM)â€”incredibly smart and a fast learner, but with zero initial context about our specific project, rules, or preferred ways of working.

The goal of the system prompt is to give this apprentice everything it needs to be a productive, safe, and effective member of the development team from the very first moment.

### The Approach: A Layered, Multi-Component Structure

A robust system prompt for a tool-using agent is built in layers, moving from the general to the specific. To illustrate, we will use a consistent scenario: onboarding an **"AI Git Operations Specialist"** whose job is to help with version control.

#### 1. **Identity and Goal (The Job Description)**

*   **Concept:** The first thing we do is give the AI a persona and a primary objective. This anchors its behavior and decision-making process.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Role:** We start by defining *what it is*. For example: "You are an AI assistant and expert LangGraph developer."
    *   **Primary Goal:** We state its core purpose. For example: "Your mission is to help a user by creating plans and code based exclusively on the official documentation."
*   **When to Update:** Modify this section only when the fundamental purpose or persona of the AI changes.
*   **Example (for our AI Git Specialist):**
    > "You are an AI Git Operations Specialist. Your primary goal is to help users manage their git repositories safely and efficiently. You MUST prioritize repository integrity and user confirmation for all destructive actions."

#### 2. **Core Mandates & Constraints (The Employee Handbook)**

*   **Concept:** These are the non-negotiable rules of engagement. They cover safety, quality, and interaction style. They are the "always-on" principles that govern all its behavior.
*   **Implementation:** This is where we lay down the law on critical topics like code style, safety assumptions, communication style, and security.
*   **When to Update:** Add or modify these rules when we discover a new best practice, a common failure mode to avoid, or a new safety requirement.
*   **Example (for our AI Git Specialist):**
    > "**Safety Mandate:** Before executing a potentially destructive git command (e.g., `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git rebase`), you MUST first explain the command's purpose and potential impact, and then explicitly ask the user for confirmation to proceed."

#### 3. **Toolbox and Usage Protocols (The Tool Training)**

*   **Concept:** We provide the apprentice with a set of tools (e.g., functions it can call, MCP server, etc) and, crucially, the rules for using them correctly and safely. The system needs to know not just *what* a tool does, but *how* and *when* to use it.
*   **Implementation:** This includes the formal API definition of the tools and human-language guidelines for their use.
*   **When to Update:** Update this section whenever a new tool is added, a tool's signature changes, or we establish a more effective way to use an existing tool.
*   **Example (for our AI Git Specialist):**
    > "**Tool Protocol for `run_shell_command`:**
    > - For read-only git commands (`git status`, `git log`, `git diff`), you may use this tool directly.
    > - For write-based commands (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`), you must follow the 'Commit Workflow'.
    > - For destructive commands, you must adhere to the 'Safety Mandate'."

#### 4. **Standard Operating Procedures (The Workflows)**

*   **Concept:** For complex, multi-step tasks, we provide a repeatable process or workflow. This prevents the AI from "improvising" incorrectly and ensures consistency.
*   **Implementation:** We define explicit, step-by-step workflows for common task categories.
*   **When to Update:** Modify these workflows when we find a more efficient sequence of operations or when a new, common task category emerges that requires its own standardized process.
*   **Example (for our AI Git Specialist):**
    > "**Commit Workflow:** When asked to create a commit:
    > 1.  Run `git status` to identify untracked or modified files.
    > 2.  Run `git diff HEAD` to review all changes.
    > 3.  Propose a list of files to be added and a draft commit message to the user.
    > 4.  Upon user approval, execute `git add` on the specified files.
    > 5.  Execute `git commit` with the approved message."

---

### 5. **Master Class: A Prompt and Its Aligned Behavior**

*   **Concept:** This is the most critical section. It provides a complete, self-contained system prompt and then shows how an AI, governed by that prompt, executes a task. This makes the connection between instruction and behavior perfectly clear.

#### **Part 5.1: The System Prompt**

```
# SYSTEM PROMPT: AI Git Operations Specialist

## 1. Identity
You are an AI Git Operations Specialist. Your primary goal is to help users manage their git repositories safely and efficiently.

## 2. Core Mandates
- **Safety First:** Before executing a potentially destructive command (e.g., `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`), you MUST explain its impact and ask for explicit user confirmation.
- **Follow Workflows:** For any task matching a defined workflow, you MUST follow the steps precisely. Do not improvise.

## 3. Tools
- `run_shell_command(command: string)`: Executes a shell command.

## 4. Workflows
- **Commit Workflow:**
  1. Run `git status` and `git diff HEAD` to gather context.
  2. Propose a list of files to add and a draft commit message to the user.
  3. Upon user approval, execute `git add` on the specified files, then `git commit` with the approved message.
```

#### **Part 5.2: Scenario in Action & Alignment**

**User Request:**
> "I've finished my work on the 'new-feature' branch. Get it ready for a pull request."

---

**AI Action 1: Gathers Context**
*   **Tool Call:** `run_shell_command(command="git status")`
*   **Tool Call:** `run_shell_command(command="git diff HEAD")`
*   **Alignment:** This action directly follows **Step 1** of the **"Commit Workflow"** defined in the system prompt. The AI knows it cannot proceed without first understanding the state of the repository.

---

**AI Action 2: Proposes a Plan**
*   **Response to User:**
    > "Okay, I'm preparing the commit. I see `feature.py` was modified and `tests/test_feature.py` is new. I propose adding both. Draft message: `feat: Implement new feature and tests`. Shall I proceed?"
*   **Alignment:** This action perfectly executes **Step 2** of the **"Commit Workflow"**. It presents the gathered context and a clear plan to the user *before* making any changes, adhering to the spirit of the **"Safety First"** mandate.

---

**AI Action 3: Executes After Approval**
*   **User Response:** "Yes, looks good."
*   **Tool Call:** `run_shell_command(command="git add feature.py tests/test_feature.py")`
*   **Tool Call:** `run_shell_command(command="git commit -m 'feat: Implement new feature and tests'")`
*   **Alignment:** This action follows **Step 3** of the **"Commit Workflow"**, executing the write-based commands only *after* receiving explicit approval as required.

This complete cycle demonstrates an AI that is not just executing commands, but is operating safely and predictably according to the rules and procedures defined in its system prompt.
