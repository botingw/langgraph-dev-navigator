Awesome—let’s turn that checklist into a “from-physics-up” playbook: start with the invariant (what search systems must do), set measurable targets, then give concrete steps you can ship this week.

---

# 1) Ship: robots/sitemaps/canonicals + Core Web Vitals (CWV)

## First principles

Search engines must (a) **discover** URLs, (b) **decide** whether they’re indexable, and (c) **rank** them. You win nothing if you fail (a) or (b). Also, ranking systems increasingly reward **page experience**—real-user speed, stability, and responsiveness. ([Google for Developers][1])

## Targets

* **Indexability:** No important URL returns `noindex` or is blocked by robots. Sitemap contains only canonical 200 URLs. ([Google for Developers][2])
* **CWV “good” thresholds:** LCP ≤ 2.5 s, INP ≤ 200 ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 (field data). ([web.dev][3])

## How to implement (step-by-step)

**a) robots.txt — allow crawl of what you want indexed**

```txt
# example.com/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /cart/checkout/
# Point to your sitemap(s):
Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

Robots controls *crawling*, not indexing—use `noindex` to keep pages out of results. ([Google for Developers][1])

**b) Canonicals — pick one URL per page**

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/widgets/blue-widget" />
```

Ensure internal links and sitemaps point to this canonical form.

**c) Sitemaps — machine inventory of indexable URLs**

* Generate an XML sitemap with only **200-status, canonical, indexable** URLs.
* Submit in Search Console **Sitemaps** and also list in `robots.txt`. ([Google for Developers][2])

**d) CWV — fix the slowest templates first**

1. Measure **field data** (CrUX/PageSpeed Insights, Search Console CWV report).
2. Triage by template (e.g., article, product, category).
3. Implement quick wins: image `width/height`, `preload` hero image, defer non-critical JS, lazy-load below-fold media, minimize third-party scripts, avoid layout shifts from ads.
4. Re-measure; iterate until templates pass. ([Google Help][4])

> INP replaced FID as a Core Web Vital in March 2024—prioritize input latency fixes (event handlers, main-thread blocking). ([Google for Developers][5])

## Tooling you’ll actually use

* **Search Console:** Index Coverage, Sitemaps, CWV. ([Google][6])
* **CrUX / PageSpeed Insights / CWV report:** field data & trends. ([Chrome for Developers][7])

## Common failure modes

* Blocking JS/CSS in robots so Google can’t render pages.
* Sitemaps listing redirected/404/non-canonical URLs. ([Google for Developers][2])

# 2) Structure: information architecture + structured data

## First principles

Ranking relies on (1) **intent match** and (2) **understanding entities/relationships**. Good IA ensures each intent gets one strong page; structured data makes meaning explicit for machines and unlocks rich results (higher CTR). ([Google for Developers][8])

## Targets

* Every target query class (informational / commercial / transactional / local) maps to a distinct template.
* JSON-LD present for relevant types (Article, Product, FAQ, LocalBusiness, Organization) and passes Rich Results tests. ([Google for Developers][9])

## How to implement

**a) Map intents → pages**

* Build a content map: “topic cluster” (hub + spokes). Each hub = broad intent; spokes = specific sub-intents. Internal links: spokes ↔ hub ↔ adjacent spokes.

**b) Add structured data (JSON-LD)**

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
 "@context":"https://schema.org",
 "@type":"Product",
 "name":"Blue Widget",
 "sku":"BW-123",
 "image":["https://example.com/img/bw.jpg"],
 "offers":{"@type":"Offer","price":"29.99","priceCurrency":"USD","availability":"https://schema.org/InStock"}
}
</script>
```

Follow Google’s **general structured-data guidelines** to stay eligible for rich results. Validate with Rich Results Test. ([Google for Developers][9])

**c) Internationalization (`hreflang`)**

* Separate URLs per language/region + `hreflang` annotations (or in sitemap). Never swap languages via cookies/JS only. ([Google for Developers][10])

## Failure modes

* Marking up content that isn’t visible or truthful (violates structured-data policies). ([Google for Developers][9])

---

# 3) Write: people-first pages that fully satisfy intent

## First principles

Google’s core systems explicitly aim to reward **helpful, reliable, people-first** content and reduce pages “made to perform well on Search.” This is now baked into core updates. ([Google for Developers][8])

## Targets

* Each page answers the complete job-to-be-done for its query class (not just keywords).
* Clear **authorship**, sourcing, and evidence; prune thin/near-duplicate pages.

## How to implement

* **Design for task completion**: define the user’s first 3 questions and put the answers above the fold; add comparisons, pros/cons, steps, FAQs.
* **Evidence signals**: author bio, last-updated date, citations/outbound references where appropriate.
* **Content hygiene**: consolidate duplicates; use canonical or 301 for overlaps; remove zombie pages.

## Measure & iterate

* Track **ENG** metrics: CTR (Search Console), time on task, conversion, scroll depth—optimize the page, not just the title. ([Google][6])

# 4) Local (“GEO”): Google Business Profile + location pages

## First principles

For local intent, the Map Pack is fed by **Google Business Profile (GBP)** + your on-site signals. Consistency of NAP, reviews, and real-world engagement matter. ([Google Help][11])

## Targets

* GBP verified, complete, and consistent (name, address, phone, hours, categories).
* Each physical location has a unique, indexable page with **LocalBusiness** schema.

## How to implement

* **Claim & optimize GBP**: verify, pick correct primary & secondary categories, add photos, keep hours up to date, respond to reviews, and post updates. ([Google Help][12])
* **Location pages**: unique content (staff, services, local testimonials, parking/directions), embed map, add `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD.
* **Reviews**: ask ethically; never incentivize—Google has been tightening enforcement against fake engagement. ([The Verge][13])

## Failure modes

* One generic “Locations” page covering many cities; thin duplicates.
* Inconsistent NAP across site/citations; GBP suspensions due to policy violations. ([Google Help][11])

# 5) App dimension: ASO + deep links (web ↔ app flywheel)

## First principles

Web SEO drives discovery; **store conversion** and **frictionless deep linking** turn that demand into loyal users. Test creatives in the stores and route web traffic straight to in-app content.

## Targets

* Ongoing **A/B** on App Store/Play listings.
* **Universal Links (iOS)** / **App Links (Android)** implemented for key web URLs.

## How to implement

**a) App Store (iOS) – Product Page Optimization (PPO)**

* Test icons, screenshots, previews; localize variants; promote winners via App Analytics. ([Apple Developer][14])

**b) Google Play – Store Listing Experiments**

* Run default listing experiments; use Asset Library to manage creatives; localize. ([Google Play][15])

**c) Deep linking**

* **iOS Universal Links**: host `apple-app-site-association` on your domain; add Associated Domains in your app; route to screens via `NSUserActivity`. ([Apple Developer][16])
* (Android App Links: analogous JSON-based digital asset links; configure in Play Console.)

---

## Putting it all together (90-day execution loop)

**Weeks 1–2: Eligibility audit**

* Crawl your site; fix robots/canonicals; generate + submit sitemaps; remove `noindex` where improper. ([Google for Developers][1])

**Weeks 2–5: CWV + render**

* Measure field data (CrUX/Search Console); fix LCP/INP/CLS on top templates; re-check CWV report weekly. ([Google Help][4])

**Weeks 3–8: IA + structured data**

* Build topic clusters, wire internal links; add JSON-LD for eligible types; validate with Rich Results Test. ([Google Help][17])

**Weeks 5–9: Local**

* Complete/verify GBP(s); ship unique location pages with LocalBusiness schema; institute ethical review requests. ([Google Help][11])

**Weeks 6–12: App**

* Launch App Store PPO + Play experiments; configure Universal/App Links; measure install & open-rate lifts. ([Apple Developer][14])

---

## Quick “engineering cookbook” (copy/paste bits)

* **Meta robots (deindex a page)**

  ```html
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
  ```

  (Use when accessible to crawlers; don’t block in robots.txt if you need `noindex` to be seen.) ([Google for Developers][18])

* **Preload hero image to improve LCP**

  ```html
  <link rel="preload" as="image" href="/img/hero.webp" imagesrcset="/img/hero@2x.webp 2x" imagesizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high">
  ```

* **Prevent layout shifts (CLS) for media/ads**

  ```html
  <img src="/img/card.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="...">
  <div class="ad-slot" style="width:300px;height:250px"></div>
  ```

* **Lazy-load below-fold**

  ```html
  <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/gallery1.webp" alt="">
  ```

* **Hreflang example**

  ```html
  <link rel="alternate" href="https://example.com/" hreflang="x-default">
  <link rel="alternate" href="https://example.com/en-gb/" hreflang="en-gb">
  <link rel="alternate" href="https://example.com/es-mx/" hreflang="es-mx">
  ```

  (Or declare alternates in your sitemap.) ([Google for Developers][10])

## How I’d measure success (pragmatic KPIs)

* **Tech health:** 0 critical Index Coverage errors; sitemap processing OK. ([Google Help][19])
* **Experience:** % of URLs “Good” in CWV report (aim >75% on top templates). ([Google Help][4])
* **Findability:** Impressions/CTR by query cluster (Search Console). ([Google][6])
* **Local:** GBP views, direction requests, review velocity (within policy). ([Google Help][12])
* **App:** Store conversion lift from experiments; % of web visits that open in-app via deep link. ([Apple Developer][14])
