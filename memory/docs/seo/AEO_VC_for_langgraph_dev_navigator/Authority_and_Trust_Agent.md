Goals: ### **E-E-A-T Evaluation Report: LangGraph Dev Navigator**

Context:
- ### **E-E-A-T Evaluation Report: LangGraph Dev Navigator**
- This report assesses the Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) signals of the LangGraph Dev Navigator website. The analysis is based on the provided scraped content and focuses on identifying strengths, weaknesses, and actionable opportunities for improvement. The target audience for this tool—developers—values transparency, evidence, and peer validation, which heavily influences this evaluation.
- ### **Missing Trust Signals**
- The most significant gap is the lack of human element and social proof. The website explains *what* the product does and *how* it does it very well, but completely fails to explain *who* is behind it.
- **Author/Team Information:**
- There are no author or creator bios. The footer mentions "Built by the LangGraph Dev Navigator team," but this name is anonymous and lacks credibility.
