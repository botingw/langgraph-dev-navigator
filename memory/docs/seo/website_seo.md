Great question—and you’re right: there’s no single lever. Strong SEO (and “GEO” work like local SEO/geo-targeting) comes from stacking multiple, mutually reinforcing fundamentals. Here’s a first-principles way to think about it, then a practical playbook for web + app.

# First-principles model of SEO

1. **Eligibility → Crawlability → Indexability**
   If a page can’t be crawled and indexed, nothing else matters. This means clean URLs, correct robots.txt, sitemaps, canonical tags, and no accidental “noindex”. Google’s own starter guide is the canonical checklist. ([Google for Developers][1])

2. **Relevance to searcher intent**
   Pages should directly satisfy what people mean (informational, navigational, transactional, local). Google’s ranking systems increasingly demote content made “for search engines instead of people.” ([Google for Developers][2])

3. **Experience & performance (Page Experience/Core Web Vitals)**
   Fast, stable, responsive pages improve user outcomes and are monitored by Google (INP replaced FID in Mar 2024). Aim to pass CWV across your key templates. ([Google for Developers][3])

4. **Evidence of authority & trust (E-E-A-T)**
   Clear authorship, citations, brand mentions, quality backlinks, accurate business info, and helpful on-page signals. Google treats “helpfulness” as part of the core systems now. ([Google for Developers][2])

5. **Machine readability (structured data)**
   Schema helps search engines understand entities and can unlock rich results (which lift CTR). Use JSON-LD and follow Google’s guidelines. ([Google for Developers][4])

6. **Freshness & maintainability**
   Keep critical pages current (content, hours, prices, FAQs). Especially crucial for local listings and product pages. ([Google Help][5])

## A practical, layered playbook (websites)

### A. Technical foundations (make every page eligible)

* **Robots, sitemap, canonicals**: Verify you’re not blocking important sections; submit XML sitemaps. ([Google for Developers][1])
* **Core Web Vitals**: Budget work for INP (interaction responsiveness), LCP, CLS; fix slow scripts & layout shifts. ([web.dev][6])
* **Structured data**: Add the types that match your content (Article, Product, FAQ—within current eligibility), Organization, and LocalBusiness if relevant. Use JSON-LD and Google’s testing tools. ([Google for Developers][4])

### B. Information architecture & content (win intent, not keywords)

* **Map intents to templates**: Guides/answers (informational), category/product (transactional), comparison pages (commercial investigation), “near me” or location pages (local).
* **Topical coverage**: Build clusters that answer the full journey, interlink them logically (deep links spread internal authority). ([Alli AI][7])
* **People-first quality**: Demonstrate experience/expertise; remove thin/duplicative pages. This aligns with Google’s “helpful content” direction. ([Google for Developers][2])

### C. Authority building (safely, over time)

* **Digital PR & partnerships**: Earned coverage and citations from relevant sites > quantity.
* **Unlinked mentions → links**: Outreach to convert high-quality brand mentions into links.
* **Avoid manipulative schemes**: They’re increasingly filtered by core systems. ([Google for Developers][8])

### D. Local/“GEO” SEO (if you serve locations)

* **Google Business Profile (GBP)**: Complete/verify your profile, keep NAP/hours current, add photos, respond to reviews, use updates. This is foundational for Map Pack visibility. ([Google Help][5])
* **LocalBusiness schema** on each location page; keep content unique (staff, services, reviews, directions). ([Google for Developers][9])
* **Multilingual/multi-regional**: Use separate URLs per language/region with correct `hreflang`. Don’t swap languages by cookie. ([Google for Developers][10])

## Apps: SEO + ASO + deep links (web ↔ app flywheel)

**ASO (App Store/Google Play)**

* **Compelling product pages**: Titles, subtitles, descriptions, screenshots, preview videos aligned to user intent. ([Apple Developer][11])
* **Native A/B tests**:

  * **App Store**: Product Page Optimization (test icons, screenshots, previews). ([Apple Developer][12])
  * **Google Play**: Store Listing Experiments (test creatives, copy; run localized tests). ([Google Play][13])

**Deep linking (bridge web search to in-app content)**

* Implement **iOS Universal Links** and **Android App Links**, map key web URLs to exact in-app screens, and verify in Play Console. This reduces friction and lets Google link users straight into your app when appropriate. ([Android Developers][14])

**Why it matters:** good web SEO drives discovery; deep links + ASO convert that demand into installs/engagement, and engaged users generate reviews/mentions that reinforce your brand’s authority—feeding back into SEO.

## Minimal, high-leverage checklist

* **Ship**: robots.txt, XML sitemaps, canonicals; pass CWV (watch **INP**); fix major rendering issues. ([web.dev][6])
* **Structure**: entity-based IA with clear internal linking; add appropriate **structured data**. ([Google for Developers][4])
* **Write**: “people-first” pages that fully satisfy intent; prune thin content. ([Google for Developers][2])
* **Local**: complete & verify **Google Business Profile**, unique location pages with **LocalBusiness** schema. ([Google Help][5])
* **App**: run ongoing **PPO (App Store)** / **Store Listing Experiments (Play)**; implement **Universal/App Links** and test. ([Apple Developer][12])

## How to combine methods (an example 90-day plan)

**Weeks 1–3 (foundations):** crawl audit, fix blockers, ship sitemaps/canonicals, implement must-have schema, stabilize CWV on top traffic templates. ([Google for Developers][1])
**Weeks 2–6 (content & IA):** map keywords → intents → pages; build/refresh cornerstone guides and supporting cluster pages; wire internal links. ([Google for Developers][2])
**Weeks 3–8 (local/app):** fully optimize GBP(s), publish unique location pages with LocalBusiness schema; launch App Store PPO & Play experiments. ([Google Help][5])
**Weeks 6–12 (authority & iteration):** ship 1–2 digital-PR assets; convert unlinked mentions; iterate based on Search Console + store test results. ([Google for Developers][15])

### Notes on 2024–2025 changes you should account for

* **Helpful-content signals rolled into core systems** (people-first content matters more than ever). ([Google for Developers][2])
* **INP replaced FID** as a Core Web Vital (focus on responsiveness). ([web.dev][6])
