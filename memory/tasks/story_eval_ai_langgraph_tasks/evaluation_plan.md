# AI Assistant Evaluation Plan

This document outlines the methodology for evaluating the experimental initiatives defined in the `product_requirement_docs.md`. The goal is to scientifically measure which initiative (or combination of initiatives) most effectively improves the AI assistant's performance across the entire developer lifecycle.

The evaluation will be conducted using a series of standardized, scenario-based challenges. For each scenario, we will first establish a baseline using **Initiative A (Rule-Guided Direct Access)** and then measure the performance of **Initiative B (RAG)** and **Initiative C (RAG + KG)** against it.

The results will be tracked against the key metrics defined in PRD section 5.1:
*   **Reduction in Hallucinations / Diagnostic Accuracy**
*   **Increased Development Autonomy / Efficiency**
*   **Improved First-Pass Success Rate / Functional Correctness**

## Evaluation Scenarios

A dedicated test suite document (`/memory/tasks/standardized_test_suite.md`) will contain the specific code snippets, specifications, and expected outcomes for each scenario.

### Scenario 1: The Debugging Challenge

This scenario tests the AI's ability to diagnose and fix problems in existing code.

*   **Task:** Given an intentionally broken LangGraph code snippet and its traceback, the AI will be asked to analyze the problem, explain the root cause, and provide the corrected, runnable code.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Diagnostic Accuracy:** Did the AI correctly identify the root cause?
    *   **Functional Correctness:** Did the corrected code pass CI tests?
    *   **Efficiency:** How many conversational turns were required?

### Scenario 2: The Refactoring Challenge

This scenario tests the AI's understanding of best practices and code quality.

*   **Task:** Given a functional but outdated LangGraph code snippet, the AI will be asked to refactor it to align with modern idioms, explaining why the new version is improved.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Code Quality:** Does the refactored code use recommended patterns?
    *   **Regression Testing:** Does the refactored code still pass all original tests?
    *   **Justification Quality:** Is the explanation for the changes clear and correct?

### Scenario 3: The Test Generation Challenge

This scenario tests the AI's ability to contribute to code robustness.

*   **Task:** Given a working LangGraph agent, the AI will be asked to write a suite of `pytest` tests covering its primary success path and at least one common edge case.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Test Validity:** Do the generated tests run without errors?
    *   **Test Effectiveness:** Do the tests correctly fail when a bug is intentionally introduced into the agent?
    *   **Test Coverage:** Do the tests provide meaningful coverage of the agent's logic? (Human assessment).

### Scenario 4: The Greenfield Implementation Challenge

This scenario tests the AI's end-to-end ability to generate a complete, runnable agent from a high-level specification.

*   **Task:** Given a specification for a LangGraph application (e.g., a simple ReAct agent or a more complex multi-agent system), the AI will be asked to generate the complete, runnable Python code.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Specification Adherence:** Does the generated code correctly implement all functional requirements from the spec?
    *   **First-Pass Success Rate:** Does the generated code run correctly without any human modification?
    *   **Code Quality:** Does the code use current LangGraph idioms and best practices?

## Analysis and Reporting

All recorded data will be collated into a comparison matrix to provide a clear, at-a-glance view of the performance of each initiative across all scenarios. The final analysis will determine the most effective combination of tools and guide future development priorities.

**Example Matrix:**

| Scenario | Metric | Baseline (A) | RAG (B) | RAG + KG (B+C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Debugging** | Diagnostic Accuracy | 50% | 80% | 95% |
| | Efficiency (Turns) | 6 | 3 | 2 |
| **Greenfield**| 1st Pass Success | 0% | 25% | 60% |
