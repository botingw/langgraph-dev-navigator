This document tracks the tasks required to execute the comprehensive evaluation of the AI assistant's capabilities, as defined in the `evaluation_plan.md`.

| Task ID | Description | Dependency | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Finalize Test Case Specifications** | - | Done |
| | Consolidate all test case details into `detailed_test_spec.md`. | | |
| 2 | **Create "Gold Standard" Solutions** | Task 1 | In Progress |
| | Create the reference solution files for all test cases and move them to a secure, separate repository. | | |
| 3 | **Set Up Test Case Environments** | Task 1 | Not Started |

| 4 | **Execute Baseline Evaluation (Initiative A)** | Task 3 | Not Started |
| | Run the AI assistant against all test cases using only the baseline rule-guided (`@file`) approach. Record all metrics. | | |
| 5 | **Execute RAG Evaluation (Initiative B)** | Task 3 | Not Started |
