# Story Spec: Refactor Epic Plan & Docs

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the epic's documentation to accurately reflect the project's new Docker-first strategy, so that the plan is clear, up-to-date, and easy to follow.

### Feature 6.1: Align Documentation with Docker-First Strategy

**Description:** Update all relevant project and epic-level documentation to reflect the strategic shift from a sequential, local-first setup to a parallel approach that recommends Docker while still supporting advanced local development.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The epic's strategic plan (`/memory/tasks/epic_user_experience/README.md`) is updated to describe the new Docker-first strategy.
    *   The root `README.md` is updated to provide clear, parallel setup guides for both the recommended Docker approach and the advanced local development approach.
    *   The now-obsolete "Automation Script" story is removed from the epic's strategic plan.

*   **Implementation Plan:**
    - [ ] `[P0 - Must Have]` **Task: Update the Epic's Strategic Plan:**
        - [ ] Modify `/memory/tasks/epic_user_experience/README.md` to remove the old phased approach.
        - [ ] Add a new section describing the parallel Docker-first and advanced local setup strategies.
    - [ ] `[P0 - Must Have]` **Task: Update the Root README:**
        - [ ] Modify the root `README.md` to present the two setup paths clearly.
        - [ ] Ensure the Docker setup instructions are complete and accurate, based on the findings from the containerization spike.
        - [ ] Ensure the local development instructions are preserved and clearly marked as the advanced path.
    - [ ] Create a pull request for review.
