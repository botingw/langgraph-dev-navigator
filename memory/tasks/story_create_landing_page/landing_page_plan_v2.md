# Landing Page Plan (V2): LangGraph Dev Navigator

**Guiding Principle:** This plan is designed to reflect the core philosophy of the `langgraph-dev-navigator` project and the `GEMINI.md` instructions: to treat AI assistance improvement as a methodical, metric-driven science. The goal is to attract developers who are interested in this rigorous approach, not just a quick tool.

**Primary Goal:** Generate user interest insight by motivating developers to understand and engage with the project's methodology.
**Primary Action (Conversion):** User clicks "View the Method" to learn about the project's core workflow.
**Secondary Action:** User stars the repository on GitHub.

### Page Structure & Content

#### **1. Hero: The Decision Block**
*Goal: Immediately state the core problem and the nature of the solution.*

*   **Headline (H1):**
    > **Stop Debugging Hallucinated Code.**
*   **Sub-headline:**
    > `langgraph-dev-navigator` provides a framework to ground your AI assistant in version-controlled truth. We use RAG and a Knowledge Graph to systematically reduce errors and improve code reliability.
*   **Call-to-Action (CTA):**
    *   **Primary Button:** `View the Method` (Scrolls to Section 3)
    *   **Secondary Button/Link:** `Star on GitHub` (with live star count)
*   **Trust Signal:**
    > "An open-source framework for building reliable AI assistants."

#### **2. The Problem: The High Cost of Ungrounded AI**
*Goal: Resonate with the user's frustration by clearly defining the hidden costs of using generic AI assistants.*

*   **Headline (H2):**
    > **Your AI Assistant is Lying to You.**
*   **Content:**
    *   Describe a typical scenario: A developer asks a generic AI for a `langgraph` snippet.
    *   Show an example of plausible-but-incorrect code generated by the AI, highlighting a subtle error (e.g., a deprecated parameter, an incorrect class name).
    *   Emphasize the outcome: Wasted time debugging code that the AI was supposed to help with, leading to a loss of trust and productivity.

#### **3. The Solution: A Methodical, Grounded Workflow**
*Goal: Explain *how* the solution works, framing it as a rigorous and trustworthy process.*

*   **Headline (H2):**
    > **Our Solution: A Verifiable, Three-Step Workflow.**
*   **Content:**
    *   Feature the diagram from `images/query_workflow_v2.md`.
    *   **Step 1: Retrieve Context:** The assistant queries a Supabase Vector DB built from the project's specific `langgraph` documentation to find relevant, version-accurate information.
    *   **Step 2: Generate Code:** The assistant uses this grounded context to generate a code draft.
    *   **Step 3: Validate Structure:** Before the code is delivered, it is validated against a Neo4j Knowledge Graph of the library's source code. This `check_ai_script_hallucinations` step catches structural errors, ensuring correctness.
*   **The Result:**
    > "You receive code that is not just plausible, but verifiably correct for your environment."

#### **4. Our Philosophy: Metric-Driven AI Improvement**
*Goal: Build deep trust and attract high-quality contributors by revealing the scientific philosophy behind the project.*

*   **Headline (H2):**
    > **We Treat AI Improvement as a Science.**
*   **Content:**
    > "This project is a living experiment to systematically improve AI developer assistance. We measure our success with clear, objective metrics:"
    *   **Metric 1: Reduction in Hallucinations.** (Goal: >30% decrease in structural code errors on first pass).
    *   **Metric 2: Increased Development Autonomy.** (Goal: Reduce conversational turns by 25% for common tasks).
    *   **Metric 3: Improved First-Pass Success Rate.** (Goal: Increase CI pass rate for AI-generated code to over 50%).

---

#### **5. Getting Started**
*Goal: Provide a clear, honest path to adoption, managing expectations about the setup process.*

*   **Headline (H2):**
    > **Get Started**
*   **Introductory Text:**
    > "Setting up a grounded assistant requires a one-time investment to configure your knowledge sources. This initial 30-minute setup saves hours of debugging time down the line."
*   **Content:** A simplified, 4-step version of the `README.md` setup guide.
    1.  **Clone Repo:** `git clone --recursive ...`
    2.  **Configure Services:** Explain the need for OpenAI, Supabase, and Neo4j keys.
    3.  **Ingest Knowledge:** Show the `run_one_time_ingestion.py` command.
    4.  **Start Developing:** Explain that the assistant is now ready.
*   **Call-to-Action (CTA):**
    *   **Primary Button:** `Read the Full Setup Guide` (links to `README.md`).

#### **6. FAQ (Objection Handling)**
*Goal: Proactively address potential user anxieties to reduce friction.*

*   **Headline (H2):**
    > **Frequently Asked Questions**
*   **Content:**
    *   **Q: Does this cost money?** (A: The framework is FOSS. You are responsible for external service costs, which have free tiers suitable for evaluation).
    *   **Q: Is it hard to set up?** (A: It involves a multi-step process for which we provide a validation script and a detailed guide. The investment in setup pays off in long-term reliability).
    *   **Q: Can I use this for other libraries?** (A: Yes, the ingestion engine is modular and can be adapted for other Python projects).
