  1. Core Product & Value Proposition Documents

  These files were crucial for understanding what the product is and why it is valuable.

   * README.md: Provided the primary "Before vs. After" narrative, the core philosophy of being a "Grounded Assistant," and the initial "How It Works" diagram.
   * META_DOC.md: Gave a high-level system architecture overview, clarifying the roles of the submodules and external services.
   * memory/docs/product_requirement_docs.md: Established the foundational principle of "Metric-Driven Experimentation," which became a key trust-building section on the
     final landing page.

  2. Landing Page Strategy & Design Documents

  These files guided how the landing page should be designed and what its goals were.

   * memory/tasks/story_create_landing_page/Landing_Page_Guide.md: The foundational guide that provided the first principles of landing page design, including the conversion
     model and the importance of a single call-to-action.
   * memory/tasks/story_create_landing_page/landing_page_plan_v4.md: The final, authoritative plan for the landing page, which defined the two-stage funnel strategy (Hook ->
     Insight Engine).
   * images/query_workflow_v2.md: The source code for the Mermaid diagram used to visually explain the "Methodical Workflow" on the page.

  3. Implementation & Process Documents

  These files provided the blueprint for the execution of the plan.

   * memory/tasks/epic_user_experience/project_management_guide.md: Defined the Epic -> Story -> Task hierarchy that was used to structure the formal implementation plan.
   * memory/tasks/story_create_landing_page/waitlist_and_survey_api_design.md: Served as the complete technical specification for building the necessary backend API and
     database schema.
