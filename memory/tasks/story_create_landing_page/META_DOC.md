  # Meta-Documentation: Landing Page Creation

This document summarizes the key artifacts and source materials that guided the planning, design, and implementation of the LangGraph Dev Navigator landing page.

## 1. Core Product & Value Proposition Documents

These files were crucial for understanding what the product is and why it is valuable.

*   `README.md`: Provided the primary "Before vs. After" narrative and the core philosophy of being a "Grounded Assistant."
*   `META_DOC.md` (main repo): Gave a high-level system architecture overview.
*   `memory/docs/product_requirement_docs.md`: Established the foundational principle of "Metric-Driven Experimentation," which informs the project's long-term goals.

## 2. Landing Page Strategy & Design Documents

These files guided the strategic approach for the landing page.

*   `memory/tasks/story_create_landing_page/Landing_Page_Guide.md`: The foundational guide that provided the first principles of landing page design.
*   `memory/tasks/story_create_landing_page/landing_page_plan_codex.md`: The final, authoritative strategic plan for the landing page, superseding earlier versions.
*   `images/query_workflow_v2.md`: The source code for the Mermaid diagram used to visually explain the "Methodical Workflow."

## 3. Content & Asset Source Documents

These files represent the final, approved content and the raw materials used as proof on the page.

*   `memory/tasks/story_create_landing_page/copy_deck_codex.md`: The source of truth for all page copy, mapping directly to the final HTML.
*   `memory/tasks/story_create_landing_page/sources/`: This directory contains the raw assets, including the chat-text proofs and the privacy policy source.

## 4. Implementation & Process Documents

These files provided the blueprint for the execution of the plan.

*   `memory/tasks/epic_user_experience/project_management_guide.md`: Defined the Epic -> Story -> Task hierarchy that was used to structure the formal implementation plan.
*   `memory/tasks/story_create_landing_page/implementation_plan_codex.md`: The detailed, task-oriented execution plan for building the landing page and backend.
*   `memory/tasks/story_create_landing_page/waitlist_and_survey_api_design.md`: Served as the complete technical specification for the backend API.
